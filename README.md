- # Hello, I'm UgnÄ— MiklovaitÄ—! ðŸ‘‹
- I'm a first-year college student studying Programming,
- with a particular passion for front-end development.
- While I primarily focus on front-end work, I'm also delving into the world of back-end development to broaden my skill set.
- I'm interested in exploring innovative web design concepts and staying updated with the latest trends in the industry.
- Currently, I'm learning the foundations of programming and honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I'm eager to collaborate on website projects where I can apply my front-end skills and contribute to building engaging online experiences.
- You can reach me via email at mmiklovaitemm@gmail.com or find me on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/ugne.miklovaite.
- Fun fact: I can't resist stopping to say hello to every pup I meet on the street.
